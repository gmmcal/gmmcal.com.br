My personal website code, playground and learning lab.

# Requirements

The latest version of this app was built using Ruby 2.5.1, but it should work on any Ruby >= 2.3. It also requires Postgres >= 9.5, Node >= 10 and Yarn >= 1.9.

I'll not provide instructions on how to install them because this instructions could potentially be out-of-date soon.

# Installing

After cloning this repository, run the following commands:

1. `rvm rvmrc create ruby-2.5.1@gmmcal.com.br --ruby-version` to create a gemset for this project.
1. `rvm use ruby-2.5.1@gmmcal.com.br` to select the current gemset. Next time you try to use this project, RMV will auto-select for you.
1. `bundle install` to install all ruby gems.
1. `yarn install` to install all javascript packages.
1. `cp .env.example .env` to have all necessary environment variables. This step is not 100% necessary, but it is advised to do.

# Database

This application uses Postgres database. All credentials are provided in `config/database.yml` file. By default, it will use your current computer username to access database. You can modify it at your will, but it should not be pushed to this repository.

After database credentials are set, run the following commands to make it ready to work.

1. `rake db:create` to create database.
1. `rake db:migrate` to migrate the database structure to it's latest state.
1. `rake db:seed` to add some dummy data to database.

# Running application

To run the application, you can run the following command.

```
foreman start
```

This will start local `rails` and `webpack` servers. By default, `rails` will run on port `3000` and `webpack` will run on port `3035`. Make sure there are nothing else running on those ports.

If everything is fine, go to your browser and load [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the website.

# Tests

This application is covered by tests on backend, frontend and integration (browser) tests. All tests are located in `spec` folder.

## Backend

Backend tests are written in Ruby using RSpec. To run the tests, simply run `rspec` on your terminal.

## Frontend

Frontend tests are written in Javascript using Jest. To run the tests, simply run `yarn test` and test suite will be running in watch mode. To run the test suite without test mode, you can run `yarn test:once`.

## Integration

Integration tests are written in Javascript using Cypress. To run the tests, simply run `yarn cypress` and cypress dashboard will open. To run the test suite without cypress dashboard, run `yarn cypress:ci`. Currently, Cypress only support tests on Chrome, so it is a dependency if you want to run integration tests.
